This simple app has been written as a demo for the Upgrade coding challenge.
I wanted to make it as simple as possible so the test class can be run using testNG,
referencing one package file.
It requires TestNG to be installed and the following libraries:
selenium-server-standalone-3.141.54.jar and json-20200518.jar

This work of art can definitely be refactored to remove all of the nitty gritty selenium
fetching into a "client" class, along with the simple http calls into another "client" class.

Thanks for your consideration.
