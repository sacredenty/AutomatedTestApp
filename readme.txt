This simple app has been written as a demo for the Upgrade coding challenge.

This app features a Client.java file and the NewTest.java file for the specific test cases.

It requires TestNG to be installed and the following libraries:
selenium-server-standalone-3.141.54.jar and json-20200518.jar

Please contact me if you have any questions. 

Thanks for your consideration.
